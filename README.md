# Drift model
Here you see the simple OECT drift model from 
`Bernards and Malliaras 2007, “Steady-State and Transient Behavior of Organic Electrochemical Transistors.”`

Please checkout the notebook 
`Bernards_and_Malliaras_2007.ipynb`

Here you should be able to interactively play with the OECT parameters and variables.

Even though there are many more options implemented (i.e. to change with the channel width and length),
these are not shown in the reported notebook to keep it as accurate as possible.

# Comments

Please let me know if you have any comments on the accuracy of the model!

I have tried to take the most literal translation from the mentioned paper, but there could be small errors in the code.

If you have any desired features, you are also welcome to star⭐ this repository and leave an issue.
